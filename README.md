# communitils

A TypeScript utility library focused on proving a simple way of breaking into open-source contribution while providing valuable and reusable functionality.

Learning to code is one thing but properly testing, documenting, and publishing code **(especially open-source)** are crucial steps necessary to complete the development cycle. This library aims to provide a low-barrier entry into open-source for myself and anyone else who wants to join the journey with me.

All contibutions are welcome, so please refer to the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!
